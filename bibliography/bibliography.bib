    abstract        = {This  paper  proposes  a  method  of  modeling and  simulation  of
                        photovoltaic  arrays.  The main objective is  to  find  the  parameters  of  the
                        nonlinear I-V  equation  by  adjusting  the curve at three points: open circuit,
                        maximum  power, and short circuit. Given these three points, which are  provided
                        by all commercial array data sheets,  the method finds the best I-V equation for
                        the single-diode  photovoltaic (PV) model including the effect of the series and
                        parallel resistances, and warranties that the maximum power of the model matches
                        with the maximum power of the real  array.  With  the parameters of the adjusted
                        I-V equation, one can build a PV circuit model with  any  circuit  simulator  by
                        using basic math blocks. The modeling method  and the proposed circuit model are
                        useful for power electronics designers who need  a  simple,  fast, accurate, and
                        easy-to-use modeling method for using in simulations of PV systems. In the first
                        pages,  the  reader  will  find a tutorial on PV devices and will understand the
                        parameters that compose the single-diode  PV  model. The modeling method is then
                        introduced  and  presented in details. The model is validated with  experimental
                        data of commercial PV arrays.},
