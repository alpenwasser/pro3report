Microchip  was chosen  as manufacturer  because one  of our  team members  was
already familiar  with their  products.  Additionally, Microchip  provides good
developer  tools  for free. For  selecting  a  specific model,  the  following
criteria eventually lead us to the \emph{dsPIC33EP16GS506}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        \SI{120}{\mega\hertz}  clock (60  MIPS): High enough  to allow  a fast
        control loop.
    \item
        2 ADCs  and 2  DACs with external  voltage reference: Required  by the
        control scheme  we use (see section  \ref{subsec:regimplementation} on
        \pageref{subsec:regimplementation}).
    \item
        PGA    (Programmable    Gain    Amplifier)   (64    $\times$    analog
        pre-amplifier): Allows     measuring     the    small     differential
        voltages     over    shunt     resistors    to     measure    currents
        (see     section      \ref{subsubsec:lt3741:feedback}     on     pages
        \pageref{subsubsec:lt3741:feedback}ff).
    \item
        Low cost of 4 CHF
\end{itemize}
