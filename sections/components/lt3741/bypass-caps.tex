The LT3741 is powered by the \SI{28}{\volt}  rail, which can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:circuit:buck} in the  top right. The switching of  the MOSFETs causes
the LT13741  to consume high amounts  of power in short  bursts. This leads to
the LT3741  feeding high  frequency disturbance  back into  the \SI{28}{\volt}
rail, which  could lead  to disturbances  in the  rest of  the circuit  if not
handled correctly.  As a countermeasure,  a multitude of different ceramic and
electrolytic bypass  capacitors in parallel  are used.  Additionally,  we used
ferrite beads, placed  in series with the supply to  absorb any high frequency
feedback.
