There is a trade-off when  selecting the switching frequency $f_S$. The higher
$f_S$,  the lower  the output  ripple voltage  will be. However,  the LT3741's
power  consumption will  also increase  due to  switching losses.   Generally,
$f_S$ is to be maximised to reduce ripple.

Because so  much depends  on $f_S$,  it is more  convenient to  determine this
value empirically through simulations. The  most suitable value was determined
to be $f_S \approx\SI{800}{\kilo\hertz}$. In the remaining calculations, $f_S$
is assumed to be \SI{1}{\mega\hertz} to allow for some leeway.

%A specific  resistor on one  of the LT3741's inputs  is used to  configure the
%switching frequency $f_S$.
