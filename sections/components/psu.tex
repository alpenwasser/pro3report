The   maximum   required   output   power    of   our   device   was   roughly
calulated   as  $\SI{24}{\volt}   \cdot   \SI{3}{\ampere}  =   \SI{72}{\watt}$
(maximum  output   voltage  times  maximum   output  current,  based   on  the
VI-curve  in   the  specifications,   see  appendix   \ref{appendix:specs}  on
page  \pageref{appendix:specs}).   Assuming   an  efficiency  of  $\eta\approx
\SI{90}{\percent}$ an \SI{80}{W} power supply is therefore required.

We chose a power supply  capable of supplying \SI{28}{\volt} at \SI{75}{\watt}
and mounted  it inside the  case.  It  can be plugged  into a power  outlet by
means of an IEC  60320 C13 socket The socket has a built-in  fuse as well as a
built-in mains  filter, which  reduces high frequency  coupling back  into the
mains from the device.  A rocker switch is connected in series with the socket
and the power supply, allowing for the end user to cut power at any time.
